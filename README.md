# Chilli-Indie
My first minigame

Hello Git-World,

I´m a twenty year old Irish/German guy and I want to start with programming especially Web-/Gamedevelopement.
You may ask yourself what the hell I´m doing here...Well the answer is I don´t know either.
A good friend of mine told me to "go use Git", so yeah..
Why am I writing this? Because the guide told me to ^^. And maybe beacause I am a hobby author too.

From Germany with lots of love and coffe,

Noah
